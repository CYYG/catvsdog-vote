* **A Python webapp which lets you vote between two options (THIS REPO)**
* A Redis queue which collects new votes
* A Python worker (designed for lambda) which consumes votes and stores them inâ€¦
* A Postgres database backed by a Docker volume
* A Node.js webapp which shows the results of the voting in real time

The voting application only accepts one vote per client. It does not register votes if a vote has already been submitted from a client.
